An interesting paper that aims to increase the time rollout of PDE solutions. The architecture is inspired from a denoising type of approach where noise of different amplitudes, scheduled exponentially are added and the model is trained to denoise them, eventually learning to learn terms ranging across the frequency spectrum.
